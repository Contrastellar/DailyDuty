DailyDuty is a XivLauncher/Dalamud plugin.

DailyDuty allows you to easily and automatically track various daily and weekly tasks.
DailyDuty is designed for people that need _**constant reminders**_ to do things or else they will entirely forget to do them.

The goal of this plugin is to allow you to more easily and more passively complete tasks that reward weekly or daily bonuses.

DailyDuty will **not** track anything to do with Retainers or Free Companies, for that use `Accountant` by `Ottermandias`

## Configuration Window

You can open the configuration window with the chat command `/dd`

### Selection (Red Region)

This area allows you to select settings, modules, or features for configuration in the Configuration area.

### Configuration (Purple Region)

This area allows you to configure the selected settings, module, or feature. Each Module or Feature will have an `About` tab that describes what the feature or module is about, and some technical information on how it works. 

*It is highly recommended to read these descriptions as they will answer most of your questions*.

## Tasks Tab

This tab allows you to quickly see the status of all the task modules.

The color of the task name indicates if that module is enabled or disabled for tracking and notifications.

Tasks that are enabled will also include text to indicate their completion status.

***Note: Some tasks will show as complete while they are unavailable for completion such as Fashion Report***

## Notifications

DailyDuty uses chat messages to notify you of tasks that are able to be completed.

You will not see notifications for tasks that aren't yet available to be completed, such as Fashion Report, until there is something that you the user are able to do.

DailyDuty also includes clickable chat links that have an associated action they will do once clicked on.
Modules that have clickable links will describe what that modules links will do, and allow you to enable or disable the link.

**All chat messages can only been seen by you, Dalamud Plugins are client side only**
 
 (Example notifications, this is not a complete list)
